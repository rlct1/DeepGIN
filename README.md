# Deep Generative Inpainting Network (DeepGIN) for Extreme Image Inpainting 
For AIM2020 ECCV Extreme Image Inpainting Challenge (both Track 1 Classic and Track 2 Semantic Guidance) <br> 
This is the Pytorch implementation of DeepGIN for Extreme Image Inpainting. We have participated in AIM 2020 ECCV Extreme Image Inpainting Challenge. DeepGIN is used for reconstructing a completed image from a randomly masked image with both satisfactory visual quality and pixel-wise reconstruction accuracy. <br><br>
